Mark Hull, aka Hulles, has been programming for a **lot** of years. He used to be able to smoke Camel straights at his desk, 
remembers big IBM mainframes, knows what **DASD** stands for, and was happy when the IBM 029 keypunch machine was replaced 
by the 129 (because it was *cooler*).

### More Information

Yes, he sometimes had to keypunch his own deck of 80-column cards, even though keypunching was for _girls_, 
because he didn't effing want to wait to compile his program.

And DASD was pronounced "dazz-dee", and stood for Direct Access Storage Device, i.e. a disk drive (vs. a tape drive).

And how did IBM know they'd produce a 129 model, when they introduced the 029 model? 
Because if they didn't the leading zero on the 029 would be superfluous, right? Boy, those IBM guys were _smart_.
